## Overview

FastImage is an Image replacement that solves a couple of issues in the React Native's image component. 


Start by installing

 
    yarn add react-native-fast-image
 

Then automatic linking
  
    react-native link react-native-fast-image
   
    
  If for some reason, the fast image doesn't work. Link it manually
  [here](  https://github.com/DylanVann/react-native-fast-image/blob/master/docs/installation-manual.md). then restart the server.
