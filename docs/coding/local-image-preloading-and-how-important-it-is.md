## Local image preloading and how important it is

referenced [here.](../packages/image-caching)

### Preloading local images are so important for the ff. reasons :
- no delay displaying the image
- better user experience

>Assets are cached differently depending on where they're stored and how they're used.
>
>For images that are saved to the local filesytem, add the image on `assets/images/index.js` to download and cache the image.
